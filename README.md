This repository contains a car plates detector using [YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com) and [PyTesseract](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/). It's a powerful and efficient tool for detecting and recognizing license plates in images. The repo includes a Flask application where you can upload an image and the detector will identify the license plate for you.
